## 🔗 Integration with Main Portfolio

The Task Manager has already been integrated into your main `index.html` with a professional card:

  <p class="project-description">
    Professional task manager with add, edit, delete functionality, smart
    filtering, and persistent storage for efficient productivity.
  </p>
</a>
```

### Access URLs

After deployment, your Task Manager will be available at:

**Main Portfolio**: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Task Manager page not loading

**Solution**: Check that all files are in the correct directory structure

```bash
tree /F TASK-MANAGER
```

### Issue: Styles not loading

**Solution**: Verify CSS file paths in index.html are relative:

- ✅ Correct: `href="css/theme.css"`
- ❌ Wrong: `href="/css/theme.css"` or `href="C:/path/to/css/theme.css"`

### Issue: JavaScript not working

**Solution**:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify script path: `src="js/app.js"`
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)

### Issue: Tasks not persisting

**Solution**:

1. Check if localStorage is enabled in browser
2. Clear localStorage and try again:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```
3. Verify browser is not in private/incognito mode

### Issue: Mobile view not responsive

**Solution**: Add viewport meta tag in index.html (already included):

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

### Issue: Back to Main link not working

**Solution**: Ensure the link uses relative path:

```html
<a href="../" class="nav-link">← Back to Main</a>
```
